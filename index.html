					<p>As leader of the Uchiha, Fugaku was focused on the clan's interest and welfare and had a strong
						sense of responsibility. His son, Sasuke, saw him as a strict man while he was seen as a
						father-figure to the rest of the clan. As Itachi was his successor as head of the clan, Fugaku
						spent much of his time focusing on the development of his eldest and little time with his
						youngest, but was very very proud of both of em.
