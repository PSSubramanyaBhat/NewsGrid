                        As leader of the Uchiha, Fugaku was focused on the clan's interest and welfare and had a strong
                        sense of responsibility. His son, Sasuke, saw him as a strict man while he was seen as a
                        father-figure to the rest of the clan. As Itachi was his successor as head of the clan, Fugaku
                        spent much of his time focusing on the development of his eldest and little time with his
                        youngest, but was very very proud of both of em. As Itachi was his successor as head of the
                        clan, Fugaku spent much of his time focusing on the development of his eldest and little time
                        with his youngest, but was very very proud of both of em.
